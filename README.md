# Water-Analyser
The project utilizes data science techniques, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced visualizations over 2880 samples to estimate water needs for different crops based on climatic and soil factors such as temperature, weather conditions, soil type and region type.
Various data visualisation techniques : boxplot, violin plot, scatter plot, correlation heatmaps, histogram, bar plots are used to find the relation between different variables .
Using linear regression, achieved model accuracy of 82.6759 to correctly predict the water need of a crop considering various environmental factors.
